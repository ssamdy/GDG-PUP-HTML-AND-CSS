    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi, I'm Sandy, a 19-year-old from Cainta, Rizal. I recently joined the Google Developer Group to kickstart my journey in web development. <br> I'm currently learning HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to explore and learn more about this. I'm eager to grow my skills and learn from others in the community. <br>Let's build something amazing together!</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy editing videos and discovering new tools to enhance my creativity.<br> I also love watching anime, especially One Piece! It’s one of my favorite topics to talk about, and I could yap nonstop about it if you ask me. <br>Additionally, I enjoy spending quality time with my Shih Tzu, as caring for my pet brings me happiness and a sense of relaxation. </p>
